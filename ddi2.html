          Nighstcout allows for visualization customization and remote monitoring.

          T1Pal hosts Nightscout and aims to eliminate the complicated tech portion

    <section class="ddi2-problem proj-container">
        <p class="proj-section-title">Problem Statment —</p>
        <h3 class="ddi-proj-content-sub">While T1Pal solves many of the technological
          challenges around data sharing and security, the setup process was
          driven by technology and complicated by the many options Nightscout
          and its plugins offer. <br><br> So we asked:</h3>
        <br>
        <h2 class="ddi-prob-content">How can T1 Pal create a streamlined set up
          experience that helps support individual diabetes care?</h2>

        <p class="proj-section-title">What's The Challenge? —</p>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <h3 class="ddi2-challenge-content">We quickly realized that designing
            for a start-up coming from the community is different than designing
            for an established company. Because there was no established user
            database and only a couple facebook groups, a big part of our design
            journey was learning and bringing together all of the scattered pieces
            of information about T1Pal to create our design challenge for ourselves.</h3>
          <h3><ul class="ddi-challenge-list">
            <li class="ddi-challenge-list-content">Who is using T1Pal?</li>

    <!-- Research -->
    <section class="ddi2-research proj-container">
        <p class="proj-section-title">Research —</p>
        <h3 class="ddi2-research-content">We started off by learning about
          Nightscout in order to review T1Pal’s current setup and to test it
          with participants. However, recruitment was difficult because the
          team had to find ways of reaching out to social media groups and
          finding 'time' where a potential participant would be receptive to
          learning more.
          <br><br>
          While we worked hard to find and scheduled participants, our team also
          conducted surveys to justify our qualitative data with quantitative data.

          target audience focuses on the first two users, Jennifer and Annie.
          We chose not to focus on Steve because these group of people would most
          likely figure out how to troubleshoot things on their own, and even
          provide help to the community.</h3>

        <p class="proj-section-title">New User Flow —</p>
        <h3 class="ddi2-flow-content">To tackle the plugin presets choices not
          being intuitive, we looked back at the user flow.
          <br><br>
          As you can see the user flow of the current T1Pal has many points of
          decision that the user has to make throughout the process and is very
          plugin preset oriented.
        <br><br>
        <img class="ddi2-currflow-img" src="images/ddi/ddi2-currflow.png">
        <br><br>
        The new t1pal, which is goal oriented, makes it so that the user will only need to select the devices they already use and just input information when needed.
        This eliminates any ambiguity during the setup process.
        <br><br>

        <img class="ddi2-iteration-img1" src="images/ddi/ddi2-iteration1.png">
        <h3 class="ddi2-iterations-content-sub">Users input their
          devices rather than having them choose what presets of plugins they
          would like to use. Inputting their devices allows for the backend to
          determine what presents the user would need, rather than having the
          user figure it out.
        </h3>
        <img class="ddi2-iteration-img2" src="images/ddi/ddi2-iteration2.png">
        <h3 class="ddi2-iterations-content-sub">Edited the layout of the
          ‘uploaders’ page and added more instructions so that user would have
          step by step instructions on how to utilize the links and qr code.
        </h3>
        <img class="ddi2-iteration-img3" src="images/ddi/ddi2-iteration3.png">
        <h3 class="ddi2-iterations-content-sub">Changed the mascot and
          theme of t1pal to be more welcoming and friendly for new users. Wanted
          to illustrate to the user how their data is going into the cloud so
          less tech savvy users could better understand and visualize what
          happens to their data as they go through the setup process.
          <br><br>
          Something an interviewee mentioned during user testing embodied what
          we were trying to get at with this new owl theme. They liked how it
          was animated and inviting. They appreciated that it was “more jovial
          instead of depressing” and “brought positivity than negativity” into
          the process.
