      <h1 class="proj-intro-title">Flixbus Redesign</h1>
      <p class="proj-intro-overview">This project was started in a design class
        at UCSD within a group of 4 people. The goal was to analyze a major travel
        site, access the top problems of the site, and choose a component to redesign
        in order to solve the chosen problems.</p>

      <h3 class="flix-bg-content"><strong>FlixBus is a bus service that provides intercity
        transportation</strong> to over 100 million people with over 2000 destinations across
        30 countries.<br><br>FlixBus Mission: “Green and Smart Mobility for Everyone to
        Experience the World”.<br><br>With a focus on the digitalization of a traditional
        bus industry, Flixbus provides solutions such as a mobile FlixBus application,
        e-ticketing, and “Where’s My Bus” GPS live tracking.</h3>

    <!-- Research -->
    <section class="flix-research proj-clr-container">
      <p class="proj-section-title">Research —</p>
      <!-- <div class="flex-container"> -->
        <h3 class="flix-research-content">After reviewing the FlixBus website, my
          team and I came up with a couple tasks to have users complete during our
          usability tests that allowed the users to be able to experience the overall
          site. The tasks were created to see how users would interact with the
          features on the website, to see user’s thought process while navigating
          the site, and to see what aspects of the site give users trouble.‍</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="flix-research-content-sub">We interviewed and conducted usability
          tests on 4 people who all happened to not have had any previous experience
          with FlixBus. The test consisted of tasks such as:</h3>
        <h3><ol class="flix-research-list">
          <li class="flix-research-list-content">Booking rides based on different
            locations and situations</li>
          <li class="flix-research-list-content">Managing bookings</li>
          <li class="flix-research-list-content">Finding information to answer
            frequently asked questions</li>
        </ol></h3>
      <!-- </div> -->
    </section>

    <!-- Findings -->
    <section class="flix-findings proj-container">
      <p class="proj-section-title">Findings —</p>
      <h2 class="flix-findings-content">All four participants faced issues with choosing
        pick up and drop off locations of the bus because of the lack of Help and
        Documentation.</h2>
      <h3 class="flix-findings-content-sub">The users were able to easily enter and
        select a city. However, in many cases each city contains multiple bus stops.
        The website does not provide a clear understanding for the users of where
        each bus stop is. As shown from the tasks, my group understood that people
        who were booking buses to places they were not familiar with did not understand
        where some bus stations were and whether or not they were close to their
        destination.</h3>

    <!-- Final Words -->
    <section class="final-words container">
      <p class="final-word">I would like to conduct more interviews and user testing
        to see if the redesign solves the user problem and if there are any other
        aspects of my redesign that I can further iterate on. With more time, I
        would also like to interview with a greater sample size in order to obtain
        a more diverse and accurate research pool.</p>
