      <h1 class="proj-intro-title">Welcome To Dexcom</h1>
      <p class="proj-intro-overview">For 10 weeks, I worked alongside peers at The
        Design Lab at UCSD as part of the
        <a class="proj-link" href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Diabetes Design Initiative</a>.
        My team and I worked with <a class="proj-link" href="http://ddi.ucsd.edu/projects/remote-collaborations.html" target="_blank">Dexcom</a>
        to figure out the best way to deliver a welcome series of content for
        their products and how to deliver it.</p>

      <p class="proj-section-title">Background —</p>
      <div class="flex-container">
        <h3 class="ddi-bg-content">Dexcom is a company that produces continuous
          glucose monitoring (CGM) systems to help those with diabetes track and
          manage their glucose levels.<br><br>The CGM is a device that attaches
          to a patient’s body and continuously reads glucose levels every 5 minutes
          and transmits the information in real time to a receiver or smart device.
          <br><br>Diabetes patients need to be able to have access to their readings
          to understand their glucose levels and administer insulin as necessary and
          maintain their health. Improper management of glucose levels can lead to
          dangerous health complications.</h3>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <section class="ddi-prob proj-container">
      <p class="proj-section-title">Problem —</p>
      <h2 class="ddi-prob-content">How can we show that Dexcom cares for users at
        all points in the troubleshooting journey?</h2>
      <h3 class="ddi-proj-content-sub">Since Dexcom diabetes patients rely heavily
        on their CGM to maintain their health, it can be very stressful and anxiety
        inducing for them when they are having issues with their CGM, preventing them
        from accessing their readings.
        <br><br> <h3 class="quote"><mark> “ Because of the way the pump is keeping me alive,
        I like calling when something goes wrong. Need it to be fixed right away, need
        to be able to trust the fix is working ”</mark></h3> <br><br> <h3>We wanted
        to provide self support resources to users when they run into issues at
        any point in their journey.</h3></h3>
