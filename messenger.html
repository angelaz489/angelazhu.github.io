      <p class="proj-intro-overview">This project was started as a team project
        for a Usability and Information Architecture class at UCSD. After the completion
        of the project, I redesigned a couple other features of the application,
        based off the results from the user testing, and came up with a prototype
        encompassing all the redesigns.</p>

      <h3 class="fbm-bg-content">Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging platform,
        that is connected with the Facebook social media platform. The messaging system
        supports many features such as direct messaging, calling, location sharing, business
        interactions, third party app integration, instant games, and much more.</h3>
      <div class="fbm-bg-sub">
        <h3 class="fbm-bg-sub-title">The Facebook Messenger application is comprised of 3 tabs:</h3>

      <div class="flex-container">
        <h3 class="fbm-research-content">In order to understand what components of the
          Facebook Messenger app were lacking, my team came up with a couple pre and
          post interview questions and tasks to conduct user testing interviews on the
          existing application. The people we chose to interview were existing users who
          were either acquainted or familiar with the application.<br><br>We asked the pre interview questions to gauge the interviewees initial understanding and experience with the app. We aimed to tailor the tasks so that the user could interact with as much of the features on the application as possible. Although we did physically observe the user, we added the post interview questions to let the user talk about their experience and maybe provide us with details we could have missed during observation.</h3>
